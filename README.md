# Instrument Cluster

# Step 1: Setup Hardware for Data Acquisition on Arduino Mega

Connect speed sensor to measure vehicle speed.

Use a voltage divider circuit to step down 42V battery voltage for ADC measurement.

Add a button for trip meter reset.

Connect an LED to indicate when speed > 35 km/h.

Establish UART communication between Arduino Mega and IMXRT.

# Step 2: Arduino Mega Code - Speed Calculation

Read speed sensor using interrupts (if applicable).

Convert sensor pulses to speed in km/h based on sensor specifications.

Store real-time speed data for further processing.

# Step 3: Arduino Mega Code - Battery Percentage Calculation

Read scaled voltage from the voltage divider using analogRead().

Convert ADC value to actual battery voltage.

Calculate battery percentage based on max and min voltage levels.

# Step 4: Arduino Mega Code - Trip Meter & Odometer Calculation

Use speed and time to calculate distance traveled.

Maintain odometer as total distance.

Implement trip meter to track distance from the last reset.

# Step 5: Arduino Mega Code - Trip Meter Reset & LED Control

Detect button press to reset the trip meter.

Turn ON the LED when speed > 35 km/h and OFF otherwise.

# Step 6: Arduino Mega - UART Data Transmission

Format speed, battery percentage, odometer, and trip meter into a structured UART message.

Transmit data continuously at a defined baud rate (e.g., 115200).

# Step 7: Setting Up MCUXpresso for IMXRT Board

Install MCUXpresso IDE and required SDK for the IMXRT board.

Create a new MCUXpresso project for the IMXRT microcontroller.

Enable UART driver for serial communication.

# Step 8: Configuring UART on IMXRT to Receive Data

Initialize UART peripheral to receive data from Arduino Mega.

Implement interrupt-based UART reception to handle real-time data.

# Step 9: Parsing Received UART Data on IMXRT

Extract speed, battery percentage, odometer, and trip meter from received data.

Implement error handling for corrupt or missing data packets.

# Step 10: GUI Design Using GUI Guider for IMXRT Display

Create a new GUI project in GUI Guider.

Add widgets for speed, battery, odometer, and trip meter display.

Design a button for trip meter reset.

# Step 11: Linking GUI with IMXRT Code

Export GUI Guider design to MCUXpresso.

Create event handlers to update GUI values based on UART data.

Implement trip meter reset functionality through GUI interaction.

# Step 12: Real-Time Data Processing in IMXRT

Use a timer-based update to refresh displayed values periodically.

Ensure smooth UI updates without flickering or lag.

# Step 13: Flashing and Testing on IMXRT Board

Flash the compiled firmware onto the IMXRT board.

Connect the Arduino Mega to IMXRT via UART.

Verify real-time data transmission and GUI updates.

# Step 14: Final System Validation and Debugging

Test speed detection accuracy.

Verify battery percentage calculation matches actual voltage.

Check trip meter reset functionality using the button.

Ensure LED turns ON/OFF correctly at 35 km/h speed.

# Step 15: Deployment and Optimization

Optimize UART communication for minimal latency.

Ensure smooth GUI transitions.

Integrate error-handling for UART data loss or system failures.

Finalize and deploy the instrument cluster system.
